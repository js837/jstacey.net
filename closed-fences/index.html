<h1>Closed Fences</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
This is originally from the USA Computing Olympiad. The problem,
"Closed Fences" (nicknamed "fence4") is as follows:
</p>

<p>
A closed fence in the plane is a set of non-crossing, connected line
segments with N corners. The corners are each distinct
and are listed in counter-clockwise order.
</p>

<p>Every pair of adjacent vertices defines a side of the fence. Thus
    {$ x_i y_i \space  x_{i+1} y_{i+1}$} is a side
    of the fence for all $i$ in (1..N). For our purposes, N+1 = 1, so that
    the first and last vertices making the fence closed.

<p> Here is a typical closed fence and a point $(x,y)$:
<img style='width:100%;' src="images/initial_statement.png"/>

<p>
    Write a program which will do the following to find the set of fence
    sides that a person (with no height) who is standing in the plane at
    position $ (x,y) $ can "see" when looking at the fence.
    The location $ (x,y) $ may fall anywhere not on the fence.

<p>A fence side can be seen if there exists a ray that connects $ (x,y) $
    and any point on the side, and the ray does not intersect any other side
    of the fence. A side that is parallel to the line of sight is not
    considered visible. In the figure, above the segments $(x_3,y_3)-(x_4,y_4)$;
    $(x_5,y_5)-(x_6,y_6)$; and $(x_6-y_6)-(x_1,y_1)$ are visible or
    partially visible from $(x,y)$.
</p>

<p>

</p>


<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>
Problems in coordinate-geometry tend to be fiddly due to a large number of
corner cases - so let's be careful!

Consider the eye to be a Laser sweeping around. It is only at points
that a transition can occur between sides that the laser is hitting.
<br>i.e. in the image below the blue point is passed through when the laser (in red)
changes sides.
<img src="images/transition_example.png"/>
With the above in mind we only need check the behavior of the laser around
points.
</p>


<p>

<b>Case of complete intersection:</b>
(Dotted line is not visible)
<img src="images/transition_example3.png"/>

<b>Case of partial intersection:</b>
<img src="images/transition_example2.png"/>

</p>

<p>
This suggests we should consider the left and the right of the laser (eye-line)
differently. On the LHS of the laser the visible line is the intersection
closest to the eye, with angle between the line and the laser smallest and
similarly on the RHS.
</p>

<p>
In pseudo-code:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
for each point in fence:

    # Make an eye-line (or laser line)
    eye_line = Line(eye, point)

    # Separate points on the LHS and RHS of the eye-line
    LHS = []
    RHS = []

    for each line in fence:
        intersection = find_intersection(eye_line, line)

        angle = find_angle(eye_line, line)
        distance_from_eye = find_distance(eye, intersection)

        if intersection is a TotalIntersection:
            # This blocks both LHS and RHS
            LHS.add(line, distance_from_eye, angle)
            RHS.add(line, distance_from_eye, angle)

        else if line is on LHS:
            LHS.add(line, distance_from_eye, angle)

        else if line is on RHS:
            RHS.add(line, distance_from_eye, angle)


    # Sort LHS and RHS to find what the eye sees first.
    # i.e. by distance then angle
    left.sort()
    right.sort()

    # Mark the first line in LHS and the first line in RHS as
    # visible.
    if LHS:
        mark_visible(LHS.first_line)

    if RHS:
        mark_visible(RHS.first_line)

return visible_counts
</pre>


<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
 Let's start by defining Point class with some useful
helper methods to help us with vector algebra. It's important
not to use any floating-point logic at any point since this will
introduce rounding errors. We use the built-in Fraction class.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
class Point(object):
    """
    Cartesian 2D point class.

    # Immutable, so use __new__ (not __init__)

        return self

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

<p>
We can now define a line Class, between two points.

            if n.x == d.x or n.x // d.x == 0:
                return True
        return False

<p>
Define the intersection method. There are a few cases so we need to be
slightly careful.

    return INTERSECT, t, s

</pre>



<p>
And finally the main logic - this is very similar to the pseudo code.
Note: we don't actually explicitly compute the angle between the two lines
since this would involve computing $\arccos{x}$ and also
computing a square root i.e. $\cos{\theta} = \frac{a \cdot b}{|a||b|}$.
</p>

<p>
Instead we use the fact that $\cos{x}$ reverses the order and then we square both
sides to avoid the square root.
