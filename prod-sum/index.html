<h1>Mr S and Mr P</h1>


<h2>
    A riddle:
</h2>


<p>
    X and Y are two different integers, greater than 1, with sum
    less than 100. S and P are two mathematicians;
    S knows the sum X+Y, P knows the product X*Y, and both know
    the information in these two sentences. The following conversation
    occurs:
</p>

<p>
    (1) P says "I do not know X and Y." <br>
    (2) S says "I knew you don't know X and Y."<br>
    (3) P says "Now I know X and Y."<br>
    (4) S says "Now I know X and Y too!"<br>
</p>

<p>
    What are X and Y?
</p>


<h2>
    A solution:
</h2>


<p>
    This riddle is all about sums and products so let's start
    by defining some helper functions:
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
def sums(n):
    """
    Get all possible x, y with x<=y that add to n.

    Example:
    >>> sums(8)
    [(2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4),]
    """
    ret = set()
    for x in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
        if n < 100:
            ret.add((x, n - x))
    return ret


def products(n):
    """
    Get all possible x, y with x<=y that multiply to n.

    Example:
    >>> products(12)
    [(2, 6), (3, 4) ]
    """
    ret = set()
    x = 2
    while x ** 2 <= n:
        if n % x == 0 and x + n // x < 100:
            ret.add((x, n // x))
        x += 1
    return ret
</pre>


<h3>Statement 1</h3>
<q>P says "I do not know X and Y."</q>

<p>
    i.e. there is more than one factorisation of P.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
def s1(x, y):
    p = x * y
    return len(products(p)) > 1
</pre>


<h3>Statement 2</h3>
<q>S says "I knew you don't know X and Y."</q>

<p>
    i.e. All of the possible (X,Y) s.t. X+Y=S have more
    than one factorisation.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
def s2(x, y):
    s = x + y
    for i, j in sums(s):
        p = i * j
        if len(products(p)) <= 1:
            return False
    return True
</pre>


<h3>Statement 3</h3>
<q>P says "Now I know X and Y."</q>

<p>
    i.e. The product XY is such that knowing Statement 2 gives a
    unique solution.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
def s3(x, y):
    p = x * y
    count = 0
    for a, b in products(p):
        if s2(a, b):
            count += 1

    if count == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</pre>


<h3>Statement 4</h3>
<q>S says "Now I know X and Y too!"</q>

<p>
    i.e. The sum X+Y is such that knowing Statement 3 gives a
    unique solution.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
def s4(x, y):
    s = x + y
    count = 0
    for a, b in sums(s):
        if s3(a, b):
            count += 1

    if count == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</pre>

<h3>But what are X and Y?</h3>

<p>It's all very well listening to Mr P and Mrs S, but is the
    solution the riddle unique - i.e. could a similar conversation
    be had with another pair of numbers X, Y. We check by brute force!</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-python">
# Generate the test set
main_set = set()
N_MAX = 98
for y in range(2, N_MAX + 1):
    for x in range(2, y + 1):
        if x + y < 100:
            main_set.add((x, y))

# Find values which satisfy S1, S2, s3 and s4
for x, y in main_set:
    if s1(x, y) and s2(x, y) and s3(x, y) and s4(x, y):
        print(x, y)
</pre>
